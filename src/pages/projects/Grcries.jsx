      This project was also made for the user experience course. The assignment was to design a simple mobile application for a phone or tablet. The process was divided into three parts: a first prototype which we got feedback on from peers, then a revised version of the prototype, and finally a usability testing plan. The requirements for the app were a very specific 16-point list.         </p>

      I first started to think about what kind of target audience I would want to reach and settled on young adults, more broadly the ages 18-30. That led me to go for a sleek and modern design that would work based on conventions while also answering to the product requirements in a somewhat unique way.         </p>

      This project really helped to demonstrate the fact that others might not find things clear that you think are obvious. Having someone look at your design and give feedback on it is crucially important for success. I also learned to give feedback on my peersâ€™ designs from a more usability focused viewpoint. This also offered the chance for me to create my first usability testing plan and I even performed it with a friend. I noticed some clear points how to even better improve the app to cater to the not so tech-savvy.      </p>
